# NASA React Demo

## Brief

This is a web application that integrates with the NASA Image and Video Library API.

It allows users to search for assets and then select and view an asset.

## Installation

- Clone repository
- yarn install
- yarn start
- Tests: yarn test

## NASA Documentation

- https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf

## Design

- Working on a much better design (check out feature/redesign)

## What to expect

- A simple, yet working project
- It's not PERFECT. You will find things you would've done differently. I am open to discuss different approaches.
- You might be opinionated. I might be too. We might have different opinions, and that doesn't make us incompatible :)
- I have spend weeks working on this project, because I have done it either during my holidays, or in my very little spare time. So don't judge timings because I am doing this for fun, to learn, and to show it to YOU. I have no deadline so I am taking my time and adding stuff in iterations.
- Unfortunately I don't had much experience with UI testing in real projects. Some companies DON'T do UI testing, and they WON'T let anyone "waste" time testing things. So I haven't had the opportunity to get really good at it _yet_. I've of course done some experiments in my own time (like this project!). I am looking forward to learn everything about testing, specially the webdriver.io/mocha/selenium combo.
- I haven't used Docker before, but I am planning to add it to this project.
- If you see something that's a "deal breaker" for you, give me a chance to explain myself. This project has been reviewed a couple of times, Taliban style, and I've been given very valuable feedback that I am using to improve it. When in doubt, ask me. Let's discuss the project. You're not reviewing the work of a machine, we're people here! Let's talk!

## Thanks for taking the time to review my code!
